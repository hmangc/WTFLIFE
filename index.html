            <h3>THE MANIFESTO</h3>
            
            <p>This isn't about me. This place is a sewer. I have been rugged, dumped, and I have lost everything. I am currently at my last friend's house trying to raise money to not get evicted with my elderly dog.</p>
            
            <p class="highlight">My underpinning ethos is to pull my money and kind out of the sewer. When I rise, those with me rise equally.</p>

            <p>I have known true suffering. All I want is to make life less shit for the little people. The ones pinned to the ground with no hope. The generation and acquisition of wealth has been democratized, yet we gamble on bullshit fantasy coins while people suffer.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "We need to take self custody. We need to back each other up and truly build communities or we are all fucked."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is my first of many tokens. Utility tokens. Tokens that have <strong>REAL value to HUMANITY</strong>. Not just cheap wins at the casino. I'm not going anywhere.</p>

            <p>I believe in me. Anyone else who wants to come along for the ride is welcomed with open arms. <em>Tá fáilte romhat!</em> In my house, everyone has a seat at the table. In my house, everyone eats equally.</p>
