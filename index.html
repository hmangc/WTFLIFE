                <p>I have literally my last <span class="alarm-text">$3 IN THE WORLD</span> tied up in this coin. There are currently 2 holders. Both are me.</p> 
                <p>I will be here until the ship sinks. Anything I make goes back into locks and burns. I will lock tokens for 100 years. I want to build an army.</p>

            <p>We are rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, bizarrely while being farmed like cattle. The system will never bend for us. We need to take self-custody. We need to back each other up or we are all fucked.</p>

            <p>This is my first of many tokens. <strong>Utility tokens.</strong> Tokens that have REAL value to HUMANITY. Not just cheap wins at the casino.</p>

            <p>I'm not going anywhere. I'm as tough as they come. There is a storm coming. I am unbreakable. Join me.</p>
