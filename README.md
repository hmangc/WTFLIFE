# WTFLIFE - The Horrors Persist But So Do I

If anyone here is paying attention still, I appreciate your presence and your support. This has been a s*** fight but I'm getting it sorted. I'm currently getting the creator fees redirected to a new dev wallet, I have literally my last $3 in the world tied up in this coin. I am the last two holders, and I'm about to publish a proper website. Well the first iteration written by Claude AI haha. Anyway. If you needed some clarification, here are the past few messages I sent regarding this coin from people enquiring. 

"This isn't about me and my future coins will also be utility tokens I'm here to stay I'm not fucking around. People will get to know me through my actions. This place is a fucking sewer I have been rugged and dumped and I have legit lost everything. I am currently at  my last friend in the world's house trying to raise money to not get evicted with my elderly dog. But my underpinning ethos is, and had always been, to pull my money and kind out of the sewer. When I rise, those with me rise equally. That's how I choose to walk through the world.

I have known true suffering my friend. All I want in the world is to make life less shit for the little people. The ones who live pinned to the ground with no hope. 

The generation and acquisition of wealth has been truly democratised. What are we collectively doing with it? Gambling on bullshit fantasy coins? Shilling rubbish and boasting profits while people suffer? Rubbernecking at humanitarian crises and military actions for trending tokens for profit?

We are truly lost us apes... Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, bizarrely while being farmed like cattle. The system will never bend for us. We need to take self custody. We need to back each other up and truly build communities or we are all fucked. 

This is my narrative. This is my underlying ethos. I'm not going anywhere. This is my first of many tokens. Utility tokens. Tokens that matter. Tokens that have REAL value to HUMANITY. Not just cheap wins at the casino. 

I'm not going anywhere. I'm as tough as they come. I believe in me. Anyone else who wants to come along for the ride is welcomed with open arms and true generosity of spirit. Tá fáilte romhat! In my house, everyone has a seat at the table. In my house, everyone eats equally. In my house, we all rise together, hand in hand.

Please spread the word. There are currently 2 holders, both are me. They have between them my last $3 in the world.

I want to help people.

This is important to me. I have nothing and I'm throwing it all on this. I have many ideas, things are coming. A storm. I am unbreakable. I never give up. Have faith in me. We all rise together.

I will be here until the ship sinks. Anything I make from this coin goes back in to locks and burns.

I don't know how long you can lock tokens but I'll do the max. Lock tokens for 100 years.

Let's fucking do it.

I want to build an army."

These communications outline my underpinning motivations here. I have absolutely nothing, yet I'll be sticking around. I'll invest everything I can get back into this, I'll burn tokens, I'll lock tokens, I'll get all the fees covered, I'll deal with boosts, I'll build community. That's what I'm about. This is my first token, one of many. There's a storm coming. Watch this space. Have faith in me. Everyone in my home has a seat at the table. Everyone at my table eats equally. Everyone by my side right is together, hand in hand. There's no help coming, we need to help each other. The greatest rebellion is in building strong community. Let's do some community building. I'm right here I'm waiting. Join me. I won't let you down.
